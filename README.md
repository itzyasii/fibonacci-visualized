## 📖 Overview

The **Fibonacci Sequence Visualizer** is an interactive educational tool that demonstrates the mathematical beauty of the Fibonacci sequence. This web application visually shows how each number in the sequence is formed by adding the two preceding numbers, while also illustrating the relationship to the Golden Ratio and Fibonacci spiral.

## 🧪 How It Works

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

```
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
```

With seed values:

* F(0) = 0
* F(1) = 1

Sequence example:
`1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21...`

As the sequence progresses, the ratio between consecutive numbers approaches the **Golden Ratio (ϕ ≈ 1.61803)**:

```
lim(n→∞) F(n+1)/F(n) = ϕ = (1 + √5) / 2
```
